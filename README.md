# S&P 500 Predictor

This project was made as a part of UCSB's ERP contest, in an effort to see if students could predict returns on the stock market. Specifically, the challenge is to predict returns on the S&P 500. This project is still currently in progress, and will be updated as the competition continues.


## TODO:
* Try VAR Model
* Try PCA
* Look into submission format for ERP contest
